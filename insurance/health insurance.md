Floater or individual: 
(all the cover will be from that total amount so if more than one person need the cover, the cover amount may not be enough)
Also, if elderly people are included, total premium will rise, so better to include young people in floater plans and get individual policies for elders

Room rent:
Room rent cap should be high or not exist at all. Since if only 50% of the room rent is covered by the insurance(because of the room rent cap), they will also pay only 50% for the treatment as well

Sub limit:
Check the sub limits, as there are different caps for different procedures

Co pay:
means to pay some portion of your bill yourself
Try to find a policy with no co pay because small portion of a big bill could still be quite a lot

Zonal policy:
Zonal policy means that the premium would depend on the city we live in - higher for high tier cities. But then, if we get a policy with address of a tier 3 city and treatment in a different city(tier 1 for eg), then there will be a co pay applied.
1. For yourself, try to get a policy that has same premium pan india
2. For elders, zonal policy might be useful if the premium for their city is significantly low

Reasonable and customary clause:
This means that if we get a procedure done, and its bill is 1.5L but the price for the same procedure is 1L in some other hospital in the area, then the company will only pay 1L using this clause.
This clause is more likely to be present in group policies

Top up:
top up means that if the base amount (which is *mostly* equal to the deductible amount) is 5L and I take a top up for 5L, then the first time I go to the hospital that year, upto 10L of the bill will be covered.
But, in case in the first visit that year, I used up my 5L from the base policy and 2L from the top up, and then I need to go to the hospital the second time that year, I will only be able to use the remaining top up value of 3L if the bill is more than 5L, and then the top up will only cover the bill amont above the 5L, so I will have to pay the 5L myself

Super top up:
However, if the last policy had super top up, I can claim the remaining 3L directly in the second visit that year, even if the bill is less than my base value


Before leaving a job, try to get the insurance policies converted  to some other policy so that the current once does not get cancelled
