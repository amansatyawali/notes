Floater or individual: 
(all the cover will be from that total amount so if more than one person need the cover, the cover amount may not be enough)
Also, if elderly people are included, total premium will rise, so better to include young people in floater plans and get individual policies for elders

Room rent:
Room rent cap should be high or not exist at all. Since if only 50% of the room rent is covered by the insurance(because of the room rent cap), they will also pay only 50% for the treatment as well

Sub limit:
Check the sub limits, as there are different caps for different procedures

Co pay:
means to pay some portion of your bill yourself
Try to find a policy with no co pay because small portion of a big bill could still be quite a lot

Zonal policy:
Zonal policy means that the premium would depend on the city we live in - higher for high tier cities. But then, if we get a policy with address of a tier 3 city and treatment in a different city(tier 1 for eg), then there will be a co pay applied.
1. For yourself, try to get a policy that has same premium pan india
2. For elders, zonal policy might be useful if the premium for their city is significantly low

Reasonable and customary clause:
This means that if we get a procedure done, and its bill is 1.5L but the price for the same procedure is 1L in some other hospital in the area, then the company will only pay 1L using this clause.
This clause is more likely to be present in group policies

Top up:
top up means that if the base amount (which is *mostly* equal to the deductible amount) is 5L and I take a top up for 5L, then the first time I go to the hospital that year, upto 10L of the bill will be covered.
But, in case in the first visit that year, I used up my 5L from the base policy and 2L from the top up, and then I need to go to the hospital the second time that year, I will only be able to use the remaining top up value of 3L if the bill is more than 5L, and then the top up will only cover the bill amont above the 5L, so I will have to pay the 5L myself

Super top up:
However, if the last policy had super top up, I can claim the remaining 3L directly in the second visit that year, even if the bill is less than my base value

Pre and post hospitalization:
These are the covers that pay for medicines, therapy etc. pre and post hospitalization.
Check how many days of pre hospitalization(mostly 60) and post hospitalization(mostly 180) are covered in the policy

Daycare coverage:
There may not be a need for admitting in hosptal for the night for treatment, those billes are covered in daycare coverage, 
we should check for that as well.

Extended coverrage:
Cover for cosmetic surgery or Ayush treatment

Waiting period:
There is a waiting period after the date of buying the policy, after which we can apply for a claim, that is around 30 days.

Pre existing diseases:
There is a waiting period for around 3-4 yrs after which we can get claim for the treatment of a pre existing disease

Slow growing diseases:
These diseases, even though I do not have them, there will be a waiting period of around 3 years, so check for them

No cover bonus:
if I do not claim anything in one year, in a no cover bonus, either my base amount will increas, or my premium will decrease.
Good thing to have

Ambulance charges:
Good thinkg to have

Cashless hospitals:
Check how many hospitals have a tie up with the insurance company for a cashless claim, otherwise we will have to pay first and then get reimbursed.

Free healt checkup:
Lot of policies provide for a free health checkup once a year, this will help to prove when we developed a certain disease

**Before leaving a job, try to get the insurance policies converted  to some other policy so that the current once does not get cancelled
