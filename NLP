HuggingFace


  Corpus -> Collection of text data

  Token -> Words(or symbols) which cannot be reduced



Preprocessing :

Removing punctuations, accent marks and other diacritics

removing white spaces

  Although removing white spaces helps to some extent, but sometimes it hurts to split only by white space, 
  for eg : 'New York', 'Rock 'n' Roll', I'm

Expanding abbreviations

removing stop words, sparse terms and particular words

Text 

converting to lower case

converting numbers into words or removing numbers 


Stemming : 

  The process of converting a word to its stem form by removing morphological additions from a word
  but it also makes a lot of mistakes :
  player, played -> played

  tradition -> tradit

  denied -> deni 


  But the reason it is still considered sometimes is because it is very fast

  Mostly used for information retrieval and classification

Lemmatisation :
 
  This process also finds the root of a word, but it does that by using a dictionary and analyses the part of the speech 
  to understand the actual root of that word.



Bag of words technique :

  create a table from the data where each column represents a word in the corpus and every sentence is a row
  and each cell has the frequency of those words in that row(sentence)

  Since each sentence mostly contains less than 98% of all the unique words in the corpus, most of that table is empty, 
  hence it is called sparse data.

  It does not capture the meaning of the text, but is able to do minor classifications.
