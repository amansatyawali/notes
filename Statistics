5 Number summary -> Find out all 3 quartiles from data (q1, q2(which is the median), q3) after the data is sorted


Outliers -> One of the ways to find whether a value is an outlier or not is by adding length of IQR*1.5 to both ends of the IQR
  and, if a value in data lies outside this range, it is an outlier.

Difference in inferential statistics and descriptive statistics.

Big data -> (For interview) Big data is defined by 3 V's
  -> (Not for interview) Whenever data is outside the capabilities of the computong architecture, it is considered big data and 
    population and sample anal ysis is required.


Normal distribution : 
  -> Bell shaped curve
  -> Approx. 95% of the data will lie within +/- 2*SD of the median
  -> Approx. 68% of the data will lie within +/- SD of the median

Difference between variance and standard deviation

Scale of measurment :
  Nominal scale -> Non numerical, where no mathematical operations can be performed.
  Ordinal data -> Numerical, mathematical operations cannot be performed to gain any insight. (Ranks)
  Interval scale -> Numerical, when we divid data into intervals. (age group (0-5), age group (5-10))
  Ratio scale -> 



Types of sampling : 


Problems in sampling :
  -> Bias in the sample
  -> Wrong data(people lie)

Factors that influence sample representativeness :
  -> Sampling procedure
  -> Sample size
  ->
